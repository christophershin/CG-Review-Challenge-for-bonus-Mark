# CG-Review-Challenge-for-bonus-Mark

For this practical activity, I chose to do this myself and so I added two shaders.

For the first shader, I used a Toon shader to harken back to the 2D art style and its low-fidelity shadows. I also used Toon Shader because it's a shader we learned in the first half of the semester.

I also added Water to the game because it's one of the core features in this image. I made it so that the waves aren't too big, so that it looks like a low tide type wave. This makes the water look a little shallower to allow the enemy moving in the water to have more grounded logic.
